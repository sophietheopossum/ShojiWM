//! The boundary between the compositor and a config runtime.
//!
//! ShojiWM does not know which language the user's config is written in. A
//! [`RuntimeLauncher`] turns the common command line into a running
//! [`ConfigRuntime`]; the compositor then talks to it with messages:
//!
//! ```text
//! compositor ── request(RuntimeRequest) ──▶ runtime   (answered: RuntimeReply)
//! compositor ── post(RuntimeEvent) ───────▶ runtime   (fire and forget)
//! compositor ◀── RuntimeHost::send(HostMessage) ── runtime (side effects, any thread)
//! ```
//!
//! The TypeScript runtime that ships with ShojiWM (the `shoji_wm` crate) is
//! one implementation; a runtime for another language implements the same two
//! traits in its own crate and calls [`crate::run`] with its launcher.
