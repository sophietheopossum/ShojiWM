# Introduction

**ShojiWM** is a programmable Wayland compositor. Window decorations,
layout, and visual effects are described in TypeScript/TSX, while the
compositor core is written in Rust on top of [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay).

This documentation is a work in progress. The pages below are placeholders
and will be filled in over time.

## Highlights

- **Declarative composition** — describe your window chrome and layout with a
  React-like TSX API.
- **Reactive signals** — UI updates automatically when state changes.
- **GPU effects** — blur, shaders, and per-window transforms.
- **Hot reload** — iterate on your config without restarting the session.

## Where to next

- [Getting Started](./getting-started/installation.md) — install and run ShojiWM.
- [Configuration](./configuration/overview.md) — learn how the config layer works.
